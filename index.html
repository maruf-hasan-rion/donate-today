                <h3>Food for a family</h3>

                <p>Sponsoring a family in need is easy with a monthly credit card donation that helps defray the cost of
                    groceries. Family-to-Family matches families and encourages ongoing communication through letters or
                    email. The recipients can check email or receive mail at their local outreach center when they pick
                    up their food or grocery coupons. Here’s how to get started.</p>

                <h3>Shelter for a family</h3>
                <p>There is a severe shortage of affordable housing in Bangladesh, exacerbated by rising rents and
                    stagnant wages. With little or no safety net, one unforeseen expense or emergency can lead to family
                    homelessness. We envision a nation where every family has a home, a livelihood, and the chance to
                    build a better future.</p>

                <h3>Education for a child</h3>
                <p>Without quality education, children face considerable barriers to employment and earning potential
                    later in life. They are more likely to suffer adverse health outcomes and less likely to participate
                    in decisions that affect them – threatening their ability to shape a better future for themselves
                    and their societies.
